I am now a Ph.D. candidate under the supervision of Prof. Ray C. C. Cheung of the Department of Electrical Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, where I work on reconfigurable computing with FPGA, and cryptographic hardware design. Before that, I was an research assistant at the LIRMM in Montpellier, France in 2019. I received my bachelor degree in 2020 from the Department of Electrical Engineering, City University of Hong Kong.
