In this paper, we propose a systematic solution that is compatible with LoRaWAN for IoT applications. We extend the standard LoRaWAN protocol with public-key infrastructures. Public-key features like Key exchange and authentication are supported by lightweight hardware implementations of SHA-2, ECDH, EdDSA, and TRNG. A lightweight RISC-V processor with a security coprocessor is implemented and verified using FPGA technology. The security protocol and the prototype hardware system are validated and evaluated on practical applications from our industrial partner. The prototyped development board consumes a static power of 0.116 W and a dynamic power of 0.206 W. The proposed system can achieve a 5.6x-144.7x speed up and reduce memory usage by 2.4x-12.3x for security computations.
