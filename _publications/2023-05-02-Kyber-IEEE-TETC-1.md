This paper proposes the split-radix DGT, a novel DGT variant utilizing the split-radix method, to reduce the computing complexity without compromising the transform length. Furthermore, we proposed a unified split-radix DGT processor with the dedicated stream permutation network for KyberKEM and implemented it on the Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA. Lastly, we designed a highly efficient KyberKEM architecture using the proposed split-radix DGT processor. The implementation results on Artix-7 FPGA show significant performance improvements over the state-of-the-art KyberKEM designs.
