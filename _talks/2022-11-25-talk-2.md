The most time-consuming function in most Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) is the polynomial multiplication modulo q. Based on the fact, researchers have developed many polynomial multiplication methods, such as Toom-Cook, Karatsuba, and NTT. One of the key strategies to implement and realize the multiplication algorithm with high performance is in the parallelized nature and relies on the compromise between the device area and the performance. However, in some lightweight scenarios, such as IoT applications, such a compromise is not acceptable because of the limited device area. In this sharing, I would introduce a lightweight PQC algorithm named the Binary Ring-LWE, with a sparse convolution product method.
